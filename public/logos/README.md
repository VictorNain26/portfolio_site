Place the official SVG files here for high-fidelity 3D extrusion.

Required filenames:

- chatgpt.svg (ChatGPT mark, green variant)
- openai.svg (OpenAI mark, monochrome variant)

Notes:

- Prefer single-path or few-path SVGs without embedded rasters.
- Remove fills/strokes that are not part of the mark.
- ViewBox should be normalized (e.g., 0 0 1024 1024) for consistent scaling.
